# PyBer_Analysis
Using Python, Pandas and Matplotlib
## Overview of the analysis:

After completing the first project for the PyBer company our boos V. Isualize has given my team and I a brand-new assignment. Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, youâ€™ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, we had to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, we created a report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.


## Results: 

### Ride-Sharing Data 2019

> The first image displays the numer of drivers in each type of city. Since we have more drivers on Urban areas we get more rides but at a lower price. The Rural rides tend to be more expensive and Suburban rides appear to be more commun and higer in average fare. 

### Ride, Fare and Driver Count Data 2019

> This chart shows the ride count data which tells us that the number of rides on Urban areas is very good, there seems to a be a very productive driver.

> This chart shows the ride fare data, this tells us the most expensive rides happened on rural areas. This information is very important because it also shows what could be the most expensive rid:
> #### Most Expensive Ride
 - Rural: over 45 dll 
 - Suburban: 40 dll
 - Urban: 35 dll
> #### Most Cheap Ride
 - Rural: 20 dll
 - Suburban: Over 23 dll
 - Urban: 15 dll

This graph show the number of drivers we might haver working with us. This means our platform is used by a maximum of 80 drivers.

Shows the relationshiop between Ride, Fare and Driver Data

### Total Fare by City Type
We can see the relationship over a period of time, and discover interesting trends.

## Summary

> Recomendations 
> - We can use the box-and-whisker Ride Count Data to identify very productive drivers and reward them for optimal perfomance. 
> - Using the box-and-whisker Ride Fare Data the marketing team can set parameters to work on new upcoming promotions. 
> - The Drivers Coutn Data is useful so that HR can track how well they are attracting new drivers. 
> - With Pie Charts is clearly that Urban cities are good for business, but Suburban could be a good option to explore since we dont need that many drivers to get increase revenue. 
> - There is an interesting trend happening on februery towards the end of the month, we should find out if is someting we can take advantage for next year.
